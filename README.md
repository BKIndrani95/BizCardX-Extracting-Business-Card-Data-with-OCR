# BizCardX-Extracting-Business-Card-Data-with-OCR
"BIZCARDX: EXTRACTING BUSINESS CARD DATA WITH OCR", aims to automate the process of extracting details from business card images using Optical Character Recognition (OCR). Here's a brief description of the project:
# Objective: 
The main objective of the project is to develop a tool that can extract relevant information from business card images efficiently and accurately.

# Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries and Frameworks:
Streamlit: For building the web application interface.
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
EasyOCR: For performing optical character recognition on the uploaded business card images.
OpenCV (cv2): For image processing tasks.
MySQL Connector: For connecting and interacting with the MySQL database.
Base64: For encoding binary image data.
Other standard Python libraries for various tasks.
 
# Functionality:
Upload and Extraction: Users can upload images of business cards through the web interface. The application then processes these images using OCR to extract information such as company name, card holder's name, designation, contact details (phone number, email), website, location (area, city, state, pin code), etc.
Database Integration: Extracted information from the business cards is stored in a MySQL database for future reference.
Data Modification: Users have the option to modify or update the extracted information stored in the database.
Data Deletion: Users can also delete specific business card entries from the database if needed.
User Interface: The project provides a user-friendly interface built using Streamlit, allowing users to easily interact with the application, upload business card images, view extracted data, make modifications, and perform other actions.

# Benefits:
Automation: The project automates the tedious task of manually extracting information from business cards, saving time and effort.
Accuracy: By leveraging OCR technology, the project aims to achieve accurate extraction of text data from images.
Organization: Storing extracted information in a database allows for better organization and management of business card data.
Overall, "BIZCARDX: EXTRACTING BUSINESS CARD DATA WITH OCR" aims to streamline the process of handling business card information by automating extraction and providing a convenient interface for managing the data.
